## Description

I worked on this project with 3 classmates at the university. Together, we recreated the classic Pacman experience, focusing on simplicity and precision. The goal is simple: navigate through the maze, avoid the ghosts, collect all the coins and power-ups, and win the game! One wrong move, and itâ€™s game over!

Note that we didn't include the traditional 3 lives for Pacman in this version. The game also features sounds to enhance the experience. Enjoy and have fun!

## Technologies Used

* C++.
* SFML Graphics Library.
* GTest.

## My Contributions

* Pacman Class: Designed to manage Pacman's behavior and interactions within the maze, including movement, coins, and power-up mechanics.
* Maze Class: Designed to represent the structure and functionality of the game maze, including cell types, dimensions, and interactions with Pacman.
* Game Over Scenario: When Pacman collides with the ghost without powerup, the player loses.
* Win Scenario: When Pacman gets all the coins and powerups, the player wins.
* Unit Tests for Pacman and Maze: Ensured that Pacman and Maze functionalities work seamlessly.
